# flexbe_strands
A collection of states to be used along with the STRANDS project software.

The majority of the states has been developed at the LAMoR15 Summer School.
The original (not cleaned-up) version of these states can be found together with additional states, behaviors, and some special purpose ROS nodes [in this repo](https://github.com/pschillinger/lamor15).

Thanks to all contributors to the development of these states!
